# Image_background_remover

Image Background Remover is a tool that automatically detects and removes the background from images using AI or manual selection. 
It isolates the subject, making it transparent or replacing the background with a solid color or another image. 
It is commonly used in graphic design, e-commerce, and photography for cleaner visuals. ðŸš€
